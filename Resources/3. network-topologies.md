# Network Topologies

Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Network Topology may be depicted "Physical" or "Logical"
> In a topology incommunicating devices are reffered as nodes and communication channel between them i.e cables or radio transmission is reffered as links or lines

`Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation).`
`logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. A network’s physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model.`

### Types of Network Topologies
> `Two important terms to study before Network Topologies` 
`1. Node - A node is a device that’s connected to the network. For your purposes here, a node is the same as a computer. Network topology deals with how the nodes of a network are connected to each other.`
`2. Packet - A packet is a message that’s sent over the network from one node to another node. The packet includes the address of the node that sent the packet, the address of the node the packet is being sent to, and data.`

#### 1. Bus Topology
The first type of network topology is called a bus, in which nodes are strung together in a line. The key to understanding how a bus topology works is to think of the entire network as a single cable, with each node “tapping” into the cable so it can listen in on the packets being sent over that cable.
In a bus topology, every node on the network can see every packet that’s sent on the cable. Each node looks at each packet to determine whether the packet is intended for it. If so, the node claims the packet. If not, the node ignores the packet. This way, each computer can respond to data sent to it and ignore data sent to other computers on the network.
If the cable in a bus network breaks, the entire network is effectively disabled. Obviously, the nodes on opposite sides of the break can continue to communicate with each other, because data can’t span the gap created by the break. But even those nodes that are on the same side of the break may not be able to communi- cate with each other, because the open end of the cable left by the break disrupts the proper transmission of electrical signals.
In the early days of Ethernet networking, bus topology was commonplace. Although bus topology has given way to star topology for most networks today, many networks today still have elements that rely on bus topology.

#### 2. Star Topology
In a star topology, each network node is connected to a central device called a hub or a switch. Star topologies are commonly used with LANs.
if a cable in a star network breaks, only the node connected to that cable is isolated from the network. The other nodes can continue to operate without interruption — unless, of course, the node that’s isolated because of the break happens to be the file server.
You should be aware of the somewhat technical distinction between a hub and a switch. Simply put, a hub doesn’t know anything about the computers that are connected to each of its ports. So when a computer connected to the hub sends a packet to a computer that’s connected to another port, the hub sends a duplicate copy of the packet to all its ports. In contrast, a switch knows which computer is connected to each of its ports. As a result, when a switch receives a packet intended for a particular computer, it sends the packet only to the port that the recipient is connected to.

Only networks that use switches have a true star topology. If the network uses a hub, the network topology has the physical appearance of a star, but it’s actually a bus.
That’s because when a hub is used, each computer on the network sees all the packets sent over the network, just like in a bus topology. In a true star topology, as when a switch is used, each computer sees only those pack- ets that were sent specifically to it, as well as packets that were specifically sent to all computers on the network

##### Way to Expand this Star Topology
`by combining stars and buses`

For example, a bus can be used to connect several stars. In this case, two or more hubs or switches are connected to each other using a bus. Each of these hubs or switches is then the center of a star that connects two or more computers to the network. This type of arrangement is commonly used in buildings that have two or more distinct workgroups. The bus that connects the switches is sometimes called a 'backbone'.

Another way to expand a star topology is to use a technique called daisy-chaining. When you use daisy-chaining, a switch is connected to another switch as if it were one of the nodes on the star. Then this second switch serves as the center of a second star.

#### 3. Ring Topology
In a ring topol- ogy, packets are sent around the circle from computer to computer. Each com- puter looks at each packet to decide whether the packet was intended for it. If not, the packet is passed on to the next computer in the ring.
ring topologies were common in LANs, as two popular networking technologies used rings: ARCNET and token ring.
