# Network Topologies

Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Network Topology may be depicted "Physical" or "Logical"
> In a topology incommunicating devices are reffered as nodes and communication channel between them i.e cables or radio transmission is reffered as links or lines

`Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation).`
`logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. A network’s physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model.`

### Types of Network Topologies
> `Two important terms to study before Network Topologies` 
`1. Node - A node is a device that’s connected to the network. For your purposes here, a node is the same as a computer. Network topology deals with how the nodes of a network are connected to each other.`
`2. Packet - A packet is a message that’s sent over the network from one node to another node. The packet includes the address of the node that sent the packet, the address of the node the packet is being sent to, and data.`

#### 1. Bus Topology
The first type of network topology is called a bus, in which nodes are strung together in a line. The key to understanding how a bus topology works is to think of the entire network as a single cable, with each node “tapping” into the cable so it can listen in on the packets being sent over that cable.
In a bus topology, every node on the network can see every packet that’s sent on the cable. Each node looks at each packet to determine whether the packet is intended for it. If so, the node claims the packet. If not, the node ignores the packet. This way, each computer can respond to data sent to it and ignore data sent to other computers on the network.
If the cable in a bus network breaks, the entire network is effectively disabled. Obviously, the nodes on opposite sides of the break can continue to communicate with each other, because data can’t span the gap created by the break. But even those nodes that are on the same side of the break may not be able to communi- cate with each other, because the open end of the cable left by the break disrupts the proper transmission of electrical signals.
In the early days of Ethernet networking, bus topology was commonplace. Although bus topology has given way to star topology for most networks today, many networks today still have elements that rely on bus topology.

#### 2. Star Topology
In a star topology, each network node is connected to a central device called a hub or a switch. Star topologies are commonly used with LANs.
