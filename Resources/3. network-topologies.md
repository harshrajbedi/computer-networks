# Network Topologies

Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Network Topology may be depicted "Physical" or "Logical"
> In a topology incommunicating devices are reffered as nodes and communication channel between them i.e cables or radio transmission is reffered as links or lines

`Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation).`
`logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. A networkâ€™s physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model.`
