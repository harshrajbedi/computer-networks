# Basic Characteristics of Computer-Network

### What is a Computer Network?
-> A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.

### **SOME BASIC TERMINOLOGIES**
1.	Fault Tolerance -> Ability of Computer Network to Work Despite of Failures and to ensure no loss of Service. 
2.	Scalability -> Ability of Computer Network to grow based on the needs and have a good performance growth. 
3.	Quality of Service (QoS) -> Ability to set priority and have manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc. 
4.	Security -> Ability to prevent Unauthorized access, Misuse, Forgery and to provide Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. 
5.	Reliability -> Make easy to use an alternative source for data communication in case of hardware failure or connectivity issues. 
6.	Sharing Resources -> From one computer to another computer over a network.
